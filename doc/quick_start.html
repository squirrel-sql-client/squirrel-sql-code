<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

<p>SQuirreL SQL Client is a graphical Java program that will allow you
to view the structure of a JDBC compliant database, browse the data in
tables, issue SQL commands etc. You need to be running at least version
1.3 of Java. Some people have had problems with Java 1.3.0 so it is
recommended that you use at least Java 1.3.1. Java 1.4 is
preferred. See the
<a href="http://squirrel-sql.sf.net/index.php?page=old.html">Old Versions</a>
page for SQuirreL downloads that will work with older versions of Java.</P>

<P>It is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under
the terms of the <A HREF="licences/squirrel_licence.txt">GNU Lesser
General Public License</A>.</P>

<A NAME="installation"><H2>Installation</H2></A>

<P>The installer has been created using the
<a href="http://www.izforge.com/izpack/">IzPack Java Installer</a>.
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=28383">Download</A>
the file <TT>squirrel-sql-&lt;version&gt;-install.jar</TT> and
execute it with the command:</P>

<PRE>
java -jar squirrel-sql-&lt;version&gt;-install.jar
</PRE>

<P>On some operating systems (currently Windows NT, 2000 and XP)
a shortcut will be created in the menu
system. For Windows the file <TT>squirrel-sql.bat</TT> will run the
application. For Unix the file is <TT>squirrel-sql.sh</TT>. The
<TT>squirrel-sql.jar</TT> file is executable so on those operating
systems that support it you can run SQuirrel by double clicking
<TT>squirrel-sql.jar</TT>. You can also run it by issuing the
following command:</P>

<PRE>
java -jar squirrel-sql.jar
</PRE>

<P>Just remember that when executing the jar file directly you don't
use your current class path ($CLASSPATH on Unix or %CLASSPATH% on
Windows) so if you have your JDBC drivers in your class path then
SQuirreL won't see them. See <A HREF="#the_driver">The Driver</A> for
more information.</P>

<P>Some people have reported core dumps with the Sun JDK1.3.1 running
under Linux. If this happens passing the -classic flag to the java
executable appears to fix the problem. No similar problems have been
reported with any other JDK on Linux.</P>

<A NAME="howtoconnect"><H2>How to Connect to a Database</H2></A>

There are two pieces of information you need to supply to connect to a
database; the driver definition and the alias. The driver definition
specifies the JDBC driver to use and the alias specifies the connection
parameters.

<A NAME="the_driver"><H3>The Driver</H3></A>

<P>A number of default driver definitions ship with SQuirreL.
These are added to the Drivers List window (<EM>View Drivers</EM> option
on the <EM>Windows</EM> menu) when you first start up SQuirreL.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/drivers_tool_window_1.png" BORDER="0"
ALT="Drivers List Window"></P>

<P>The
<IMG ALIGN="CENTER" SRC="images/ok_st_obj.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="Blue Tick">
icon next to a driver definition indicates that it has been successfully
loaded while the <IMG ALIGN="CENTER" SRC="images/error_st_obj.gif"
BORDER="0" ALT="Cross"> icon indicates that the JDBC driver could not be
loaded and so cannot be used to connect to a database.</P>

<P>All of the default driver definitions assume that the JDBC driver
classes are in the current class path or in your JRE extensions
directory (consult the documentation for your Java implementation for
more information on this). If this is not the case you will need to
modify the driver definition to point to the jar file or the classes
directory that contains these classes.

<P>You can create new driver definitions using the <EM>New Driver</EM>
option on the <EM>Drivers</EM> menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/chg_driver_1.png"
BORDER="0" ALT="Change Driver dialog (Java Class Path tab)"></A></P>

<P>This is an example of a driver definition. This dialog can be
displayed by selecting a driver definition in the Drivers List window
and then selecting the <EM>Modify Driver</EM> option from the
<EM>Drivers</EM> menu.

<P>The <EM>Name</EM> text field specifies an easy to remember name for
the database driver definition and is the text shown in the Drivers
List window.</P>

<P>The <EM>Example URL</EM> shows an example URL for this driver. This
can be found in the documentation that comes with the driver. This is
only an example URL, the actual URL is defined in the alias.</P>

<P>The entries in the <EM>Java Class path</EM> tab show the
directories and jars in the current class path. If you click on a jar
file and press the <EM>List Drivers</EM> button then the class names
of all the JDBC drivers in that jar will be placed in the <EM>Class
Name</EM> dropdown control.

<P>The <EM>Class Name</EM> specifies the class name of the JDBC
driver. Either select an existing entry in the dropdown or key in the
class name of the JDBC driver (it can normally be found in the
documentation that comes with the driver).

<P>The <EM>Extra Class Path</EM> tab allows you to select a JDBC
driver that is in a jar file or a directory that is not in the current
class path.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/chg_driver_2.png" BORDER="0" ALT="Change
Driver dialog (Extra Class Path tab)"></A></P>

<P>The <EM>Add</EM> button will display a File Open dialog
allowing you to select one or more jar files or directories. The
<EM>Delete</EM> button allows you to remove a jar file or directory
from the list. The <EM>Up</EM> and <EM>Down</EM> buttons allow you to
change the sequence of the entries. The <EM>List Drivers</EM> button
will place the class names of all the JDBC drivers in the currently
selected jar file into the <EM>Class Name</EM> dropdown.</P>

<P>Press the <EM>OK</EM> button to save the driver definition and close the
window or the <EM>Close</EM> button to close the window without saving
any changes.</P>

<A NAME="the_alias"><H3>The Alias</H3></A>

<P>Now you need to create an alias to your database.</P>

<P>Display the Aliases List window (<EM>View Aliases</EM>
option on the <EM>Windows</EM> menu). When you run SQuirreL
for the first time this window will be empty.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/aliases_tool_window_1.png" BORDER="0"
ALT="Aliases List Window">

<P>Take the <EM>New Alias</EM> option from the <EM>Aliases</EM> menu
and the following dialog will be displayed.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/add_alias_1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="Add
New Alias Window"></P>

<P>Enter an easy to remember name in the <EM>Name</EM> field for this
database URL. This is the text that will be displayed in the Aliases
List Window.</P>

<P>Select the driver for this alias from the <EM>Driver</EM> dropdown
or click on the <EM>New</EM> button to create a new driver
definition.</P>

<P>Change the <EM>URL</EM> to point to your database.</P>

<P>Optionally enter a user name if you want the alias to default to a
specific user.</P>

<P>The <EM>Test</EM> button will allow you to attempt to connect to
your alias to ensure that the parameters you have entered are
correct.</P>

<P>Press the <EM>OK</EM> button to save the alias definition and close the
window or the <EM>Close</EM> button to close the window without saving
any changes.</P>

<BR CLEAR="LEFT">

<A NAME="connecting"><H3>Connecting</H3></A>

<P>The new alias should now appear in the <EM>Connect To</EM>
dropdown. Select it in the dropdown and enter your user name and
password in the connection dialog, press <EM>OK</EM> and you should be
connected.</P>

<A NAME="sessionwindow"><H2>Session Window</H2></A>

<P>When you first connect to a database a Session window will be
shown.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/session_1.png" BORDER="0"
			ALT="Session Window"></P>

<P>The Object Tree on the left shows the structure of the database.
Clicking on various nodes within this object tree will show further
information in the right hand detail panel. In this example the
database metadata is shown. Clicking on the title of a column will
sort the display by the data in that column. This is true of all
tabular displays in SQuirreL.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/session_2.png" BORDER="0"
			ALT="Session Window Showing a Table"></P>

<P>This shows the data displayed when a table is selected in the
Object Tree.</P>

<A NAME="executing"><H2>Executing SQL</H2></A>

<P>SQL can be executed from the SQL tab in the window that opens once
you have connected to an alias. Multiple statements can be executed
and the results will be displayed in multiple tabs below the SQL entry
area.</P>

<P>When the SQL tab is selected pressing
<TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>, taking the Execute SQL option from
the Session menu or pressing the Execute SQL button in the session
window tool bar will execute the entered SQL.</P>

<P>If a single statement is entered then pressing
<TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT> will execute just that
statement.</P>

<P>If you only want to execute part of the SQL entered then highlight
the SQL that you want to execute and press
<TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>.</P>

<P>To only execute a single statement amongst several statements
(separated from the other statements by at least one blank line)
within the SQL entry area then click on the line containing the
statement that you want to execute and press
<TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>.</P>

<P>The characters -- at the beginning of a line will turn it into a
comment.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/sql_1.png" BORDER="0"
			ALT="Executing SQL"></P>

<P>As can be seen in the above screen shot, double clicking in a cell in
the query results will open up a new window showing the entire
contents of the cell.</P>

<P>The <IMG SRC="images/createresultwindow.gif" BORDER="0"

<A NAME="editingdata"><h2>Editing Data in the Contents Tab</h2></A>

<P>SQuirreL allows you to easily change the data in a table. Data may
be changed just by typing the new values when you are viewing the table
in the Contents tab under the Objects view.</P>

<A NAME="enablingediting"><h3>Enabling Editing</h3></A>

<P>When initially set up, the Contents Tab may be set in a read-only
mode. This is a safety precaution. Once a table is made editable, any
change that you make is made immediately in the database. While
extremely convenient, this is dangerous. With this capability enabled,
it becomes very easy to accidentally destroy data, violate some
consistancy checks, mis-direct references between tables, etc. On the
other hand, the author of this feature runs with editing always enabled.
It is simpler that way, but has the potential for disaster. <b>You have
	been warned!</b></P>

<P>You can set SQuirreL so that tables are editable all the time, or you
can enable editing on a specific table as you are working on it. Either
option may be set as your default mode of operation, and either option
may be selected for use on a specific table.</P>

<P>Editing may only be done in the Object view, not on the results of
manually entered SQL queries run under the SQL view. At this time the
only data that may be edited is the Contents tab of individual
tables.</P>

<a name="Setting_the_Editing_Mode"><h4>Setting the Editing Mode</h4></a>

<P>To set the default format for the Contents Tab for new sessions take
the <em>New Session Properties</em> option from the <em>File</em> and
click on the <EM>General</EM> tab. The <b>Table Contents</b> dropdown
list gives three options for the format of the Comtemts Tab:</P>

<dl>
	<dt>Table</dt>
	<dd>The data in the Contents tab is a read-only table. You may click in
	any cell or tab through the table and any accidental typing you do will
	be ignored and not change the database. To enable editing on this table,
	click on the right mouse button and select the <b>Make Editable</b>
	option. This makes that table <i>and only that table</i> editable.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Text</dt>
	<dd>The data in the Contents tab is shown as simple formatted text and
	is read-only. To enable editing on this table, ;click on the right mouse
	button and select the <b>Make Editable</b> option. This makes the table
	<i>and only that table</i> editable</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>Editable Table</dt>
	<dd>The data in the Contents tab is an editable table. Changes
	made to the data in this view are made to the database.</dd>
</dl>

<P>After you have connected with a database, you may change the default
model for the data in the Contents tab by the <em>Session
	Properties</em> option from the <em>Session</em> and clicking on the
<EM>General</EM> tab and changing the selection for <em>Table
	Contents</em>.</P>

<A name="howtoedit"><h3>How To Edit</h3><A>

<P>Here is how to edit data in the table:</P>

<ol>
	<li>Connect to the database.</li>

	<li>Select a table in the object tree and select the
		<EM>Contents</EM> tab to view the data.</li>

	<li>Make sure the table is editable. See <a
		href="#Setting_the_Editing_Mode">Setting the Editing
		Mode</a> above.</li>

	<li>Select the cell that you want to edit. This may be done
		either by using the keyboard (tab and enter keys) to move around the
		table to reach the cell, or you may click on the cell with the
		mouse. Note that if a cell cannot be edited (see <a
			href="#Limitations">Limitations</a>) you may select the cell,
		but you will not be allowed to edit the data.</li>

	<li>Change the data in the cell to look the way that you want it
		to. Editing is done in the usual way by typing characters,
		using delete to erase, and using the mouse to select a point to
		insert or characters to delete. There are a couple of
		specialized features that are described later in this
		section.</li>

	<li>When the data in the cell looks the way you want,
		leave the cell by pressing the tab key, the enter key, or
		clicking on another cell with the mouse. This
		causes the data in that cell to be updated in the DB.</li>

</ol>

<P>If the data in the cell gets really messed up and you are confused about
what is going on, press the <DELETE> key. If that doesn't work then close the
database connection without leaving the cell (&lt;ctrl&gt;W or click the close
button).  This will abort the operation and avoid changing the DB.</P>

<P>If the cell contains a NULL value, that is shown as the string
"&lt;null&gt;". To change that to a non-null value, just type the
new data. When you enter the first character of the data, the
"&lt;null&gt;" will be replaced by that character.</P>

<P>To change the value of a nullable cell to NULL, just delete all of the data
in that cell. When you delete all of the data in a cell, the contents of
the cell will be set to "&lt;null&gt;". Since the VARCHAR data types allow a
non-null empty string, for those cells you must delete all of the data so that
the cell is blank, and then press delete. The VARCHAR cell will then be set to
&lt;null&gt;.</P>

<P>If a cell is not nullable, deleting the last character in the cell will
leave the cell blank. You may then enter new data for the cell.</P>

<P>To restore the cell to its original value, delete all of the data in the
 cell, then press the delete key one more time. This will cause the
cell to be reset to its original value. For cells that allow nulls,
continually pressing the delete key causes a cycle:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original data -&gt;&nbsp; delete data -&gt; &nbsp;&lt;null&gt;
-&gt; original data</P>

<P>and for cells that do not allow nulls:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original data -&gt; delete data -&gt; blank cell -&gt;
original data</P>

<P>Thus, if you mess up the contents of a cell, just press the delete key
until you see the original data reappear.</P>

<P>When leaving the cell, if the cell data is identical to the original contents
of the cell, the DB will not be updated.</P>

<h3><a name="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h3>

<P>Editing only works for JDBC types of INTEGER, SMALLINT, TINYINT,
CHAR, VARCHAR, LONGCHAR and JDBC codes -8 and -9. It has not been
tested with TINYINT, LONGCHAR or types -8 and -9. Other types will be
included in the future.</P>

<P>Some attempt has been made to validate user input for each of the
types. For example, INTEGER fields allow only digits and '-' as input.
However, not all of the necessary information is supplied by all DBMSs,
so we cannot do a complete validation of user input in all cases. For
example, we cannot check that a value entered for a SMALLINT field
will fit into a SMALLINT column in this DBMS. The "validation of last
resort" is done when we try to do an update on the DB. The DBMS either
succeeds or it fails, and if there is an error we display that message
to the user with the information that the DB has not been updated.</P>

<P>VARCHAR fields cannot include tab or newline. VARCHAR fields
that may be set to null cannot be set to the string value
"&lt;null&gt; " without the quotes. VARCHAR fields in the database may
include those values as long as you do not try to edit them.</P>

<P>If you have the "Show String Data" function disabled for any data
type (e.g. the table shows "&lt;BINARY&gt;" rather than the actual
data), you may not be able to make changes in tables using that data
type. This has not been tested, so we don't know if it will work
or not.</P>

<P>The pop-up window that is created when you double-click on a cell is
not editable. We hope to make it editable in the future.</P>

<A NAME="summary_of_how_it_works"><h3>Summary of How it works (and why
		you may care)</h3></A>

<P>The DB updates are based on the assumption that the list of DB column names
and their values for the current row are unique, or if they are not unique,
that all of the rows with those values are to be updated in the DB. For
example, if you have a database with columns a, b, and c, and in a particular
row you have the values</P>

<PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a=34 &nbsp;b='your name' &nbsp;c=55
</PRE>

<P>and you change column c to be 66, then SQuirreL does the following:</P>

<ol>
	<li>Query the DB for how many rows contain a=34, b='your name', and
	c=55. If there are more than one, then the update will affect all
	of those rows, so SQuirreL asks if you want to do that before
	continuing.</li>

	<li>Query the DB for how many rows contain a=34, b='your
	name' and c=66. If there are any existing rows with
	those values, changing the current row to c=66 will make
	the current row identical to the existing row(s), so
	SQuirreL asks if you want to do that before
	continuing.</li>

	<li>Create and execute the following:</li>
</ol>

<PRE>
update &lt;table&gt; set c=66 where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a=34 and b='your name' and c=55
</PRE>

<P>To help distinguish rows that are similar to each other, any DBMS that provides
a pseudo-column to uniquely identify each row (such as Oracle's ROWID) has
that pseudo-column included in all querys.</P>

<P>The problem with this is that some columns cannot be handled in this
way, most notably BLOBs and CLOBs. Thus, if your table contains
BLOB or CLOB columns, SQuirreL may think that rows are identical because
all of the non-BLOB/CLOB fields are identical, but the rows are actually
not the same because the contents of the BLOB/CLOB fields differ.
This could lead to "erroneous" warning messages.</P>

<A NAME="quirks"><h3>Quirks, Oddities and Known Bugs and
		work-arounds</h3></A>

<ul>

	<li>After error or warning messages, the focus is lost. You
	will need to click on a cell in order to continue editing.</li>

	<li>When using the enter key to leave a cell, you must press it two times.
	The first time causes the data to be updated in the DB, but leaves
	you back in the same cell. Pressing enter again moves to the cell
	below the current one.<br> </li>

</ul>

<A NAME="data_types"><H2>Data Types</H2></A>

<P>This is a quick description of how SQuirreL handles various data types when
displaying the results of SQL statements. SQuirreL uses the column type
(ResultSetMetaData.getColumnType(...)) from the metadata for the result set to
determine how to display the column.</P>

<DL>
	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.NULL</B>
	<DD><EM>&lt;Null&gt;</EM> is displayed.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.BOOLEAN and java.sql.Types.BIT</B>
	<DD>If the retrieved column data is a <EM>java.lang.Boolean</EM> object
	then the appropriate <EM>true/false</EM> is displayed. If the retrieved
	column is a <EM>java.lang.Number</EM> then a non-zero value will display
	<EM>true</EM> while a zero value will display <EM>false</EM>. Otherwise the
	column data is converted to a string and if this string equals (ignoring
	case) &quot;true&quot; then <EM>true</EM> is displayed else <EM>false</EM>.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.TIME</B>
	<DD>A <EM>java.sql.Time</EM> object is retrieved from the result set and
	displayed in <EM>hh:mm:ss</EM> format.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.DATE</B>
	<DD>A <EM>java.sql.Date</EM> object is retrieved from the result set and
	displayed in <EM>yyyy-mm-dd</EM> format.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.TIMESTAMP</B>
	<DD>A <EM>java.sql.TimeStamp</EM> object is retrieved from the result set
	and displayed in <EM>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.fffffffff</EM> format.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.BIGINT</B>
	<DD>If the retrieved column type is a <EM>java.lang.Long</EM> or a
	<EM>java.lang.Number</EM> then it is stored as a <EM>java.lang.Long</EM>
	and displayed as a base ten signed long. Otherwise the column data is
	converted to a string which is then parsed as a base ten signed long.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.DOUBLE, java.sql.Types.FLOAT, java.sql.Types.REAL</B>
	<DD>If the retrieved column type is a <EM>java.lang.Double</EM> or a
	<EM>java.lang.Number</EM> then it is stored as a <EM>java.lang.Double</EM>
	and displayed as a string representation of the double. Otherwise the
	column data is converted to a string which is then parsed as a double.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.DECIMAL, java.sql.Types.NUMERIC</B>
	<DD>If the retrieved column type is a <EM>java.math.BigDecimal</EM> or a
	<EM>java.lang.Number</EM> then it is stored as a <EM>java.math.BigDecimal</EM>
	and displayed as a string representation of the <EM>BigDecimal</EM>. Otherwise the
	column data is converted to a string which is then parsed as a <EM>BigDecimal</EM>.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.INTEGER, java.sql.Types.SMALLINT, java.sql.Types.TINYINT</B>
	<DD>If the retrieved column type is a <EM>java.lang.Integer</EM> or a
	<EM>java.lang.Number</EM> then it is stored as a <EM>java.lang.Integer</EM>
	and displayed as a string representation of the <EM>Integer</EM>. Otherwise the
	column data is converted to a string which is then parsed as a <EM>Integer</EM>.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.CHAR, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR, java.sql.Types.LONGVARCHAR</B>
	<DD>The column data is displayed as a string.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.BINARY, java.sql.Types.VARBINARY, java.sql.Types.LONGVARBINARY</B>
	<DD>If the appropriate <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A> says
	to retrieve data of this type then the column data is displayed as a string
	otherwise one of <EM>&lt;Binary&gt;</EM>, <EM>&lt;Varbinary&gt;</EM> or
	<EM>&lt;Longvarbinary&gt;</EM> is displayed.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.BLOB</B>
	<DD>If the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A>
	says to retrieve blobs then the column data is displayed as bytes. Note
	that the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A> can
	specify the number of bytes of the blob to read in.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.CLOB</B>
	<DD>If the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A>
	says to retrieve clobs then the column data is displayed as a string. Note
	that the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A> can
	specify the number of characters of the clob to read in.

	<DT><B>java.sql.Types.OTHER</B>
	<DD>If the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A>
	says to retrieve columns of this type then the column data is displayed as
	a string.

	<DT><B>Any other type</B>
	<DD>If the <A HREF="#session_props_sql_data_types">session property</A>
	says to retrieve all other data types then the column data is displayed
	as a string.

<A NAME="plugins"><H2>Plugins</H2></A>

<P>A plugin is an application written in Java that runs within
SQuirreL. This allows developers to enhance the functionality of
SQuirreL without having to rebuild the SQuirreL application itself. It
also allows you to &quot;pick and choose&quot; the functionality that
you want in SQuirreL. For instance if you don't use Oracle then you
don't need the Oracle specific functionality supplied by the Oracle
plugin.</P>

<P>Plugins can be downloaded from the SQuirreL web site
http://squirrel-sql.sf.net</P>

<P>To install a plugin unpack the zip or gz file into the plugins
directory within the SQuirreL application directory keeping
the directory structure. To use the plugin you will need to restart
SQuirreL.</P>

<P>The &quot;Summary&quot; option on the &quot;Plugins&quot; menu will
display a dialog box showing the plugins currently installed.</P>
