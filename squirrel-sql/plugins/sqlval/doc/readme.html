<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This plugin will validate your SQL against the ISO SQL standard. It
does this by using a Web Service provided by Mimer SQL. The SQL that is
validated is stored anonymously to be used by the ISO SQL Standards
committee.</P>

<P>If you can't connect to the SQL Validation web service then you
may need to specify a proxy server in the &quot;Proxy&quot; tab of the Global
Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>For more information
on the web service consult http://sqlvalidator.mimer.com</P>

<p><EM>Note</EM> If you use this plugin with JDK 1.3 you will need a
JAXP 1.1 XML compliant parser such as <A
	HREF="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces</A> or the <A
	HREF="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/index.html"> JAXP 1.1 reference
	implementation</A>. Copy the jar files from your XML parser to the
directory &lt;squirrel-sql&gt;/plugins/sqlval/lib. For xml-xerces this
should be xerces.jar and for JAXP 1.1 reference implementation this
should be crimson.jar and jaxp.jar.</p>

<H2>New Global Preferences Tab</H2>

<P>The Global Preferences dialog has a new &quot;SQL Validator&quot; tab.
This specifies the information to send to the Web Service. You can either
logon anonymously or use a user name and password that have been supplied
to you by Mimer SQL.</P>

<P>You can choose whether to send client details to the Web Service. If the
&quot;Anonymous Client&quot; checkbox is unchecked then the Client and
Version details shown will be sent to the Web Service along with your
validation request otherwise &quot;N/A&quot; will be sent for these
fields.</P>

<H2>New Menu Items</H2>

<P>An &quot;SQL Validation&quot; hierarchical menu has been added to the
&quot;Session&quot; menu. This has the following menu items:

<DL>
<DT><B>Connect to SQL Validator</B>
<DD>This will present you with a &quot;logon&quot; dialog and allow you
	to connect to the SQL Validation web service. If you have already
	connected then the previous connection will first be closed.

<DT><B>Disconnect from SQL Validator</B>
<DD>If you have previously connected to the SQL Validation web service
	then this option will disconnect you.

<DT><B>Validate SQL</B>
<DD>This option will attempt to validate the current SQL in the
	SQL entry area. If you aren't connected to the SQL Validation web
	service then it will first display a &quot;logon&quot; dialog to
	allow you to connect. Results are shown in the message area at the
	bottom of the session window.
