SQuirreL SQL Client Change Log
==============================

- Fix for not shown SQL result on derby DB
- Right Mouse Menu on SQL result tabs (Not working on JDK 1.4 with scrollable tabbed panes due to Bug #4465870.)
  Functions also available in tools popup
- Session property: Limit SQL result tabs.
  By default limiting is switched on and set to 15 tabs.   
- Fixed Bug #1234642 (Missing query numbers in message panel)
- When executing a SQL batch (several SQL's separated by statement separator)
  in case of an error the errornous SQL is printed to the message panel.
- From within the SQL Editor one can jump to the Object at cursor in the Object tree.
  To do so use the ctrl+B shortcut or the right mouse menu or the tools popup (ctrl+T)
- New Session property: 'Write SQL Execution Errors to log file'.
  The execution errors of an SQL statement shown in the message panel
  may now also be written to the squirrel-sql.log file
- Fixed bug #1244287
- Mnemonics for Main Tabbed Pain
- Fixes in editing SQL Results:
  Editing didn't work when a column was in the select list twice
  Editing didn't work when a column was when the statement was like 'SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY MyID'

Bug Fixes
---------
- Put up a new splash screen that worked with JDK1.4

The following fixes were actually done in 1.0final1 but I forget
to update this file.

- Removed wrong path separator used in the install script for
  <instdir>\plugins\lafs and <instdir>\plugins\skins which
  didn't work under Unix.
- Got working with Sybase/jConnect.


1.0 final
===============================

Bug Fixes
------------
- Handle gracefully the errors caused by JDBC drivers that require a more
  recent version of the JDK than the one that Squirrel SQL is being run on.
- Popup menus are now correctly positioned under JDK1.2

Enhancements
------------
- I'm now using the IzPack Java installer from
  http://www.izforge.com/izpack
- Thanks to Greg Mackness, Squirrel SQL now has a decent splash screen.


1.0 beta7

  function calls.

1.0 beta6
===============================

Bug Fixes
------------
- New sessions didn't take into account the "SQL Limit Rows"
  setting from the "New Session" Application Settings tab. It
  always defaulted to true.
- The hourglass cursor was shown after the main window was created.
- If the preferences positioned the main window (or aliases/drivers
  tool windows) to a position on the screen only visible under a
  high resolution (EG 1024X768) and you then changed the display
  resolution to one under which the window could not be seen then
  when Squirrel-SQL was started the window could not be seen.
- If you tried to maintain a driver with a Driver JAR file that
  didn't exist an error dialog that couldn't be dismissed was
  displayed.
- Errors that occured for metadata information (such as data types) didn't
  always display in the message area.
- Errors in SQL Driver Maintenance weren't always displayed.
- If invalid data for the data type in a column (E.G. blanks in a numeric)
  were found in metadata information (such as data types) then no further
  information was displayed.

Enhancements
------------
- User name now displayed in the title for a session window.
- Logging is now done to a text file (squirrel-sql.log) in the user
  perferences directory instead of to standard output.
- You can now drop a Look and Feel implementation (see www.javatoo.com
  for examples of Look and Feel implementations) into the /plugins/lafs
  directory within the application directory and have it selectable from
  the "Look and Feel" dropdown on the General tab of the Global
  Preferences dialog.

Changes
-------
- Global Preferences option is now on the File menu.

===============================

Bug Fixes
------------
- If a connection failed to open the error wasn't always displayed.
- If an image couldn't be found for an Action the application wouldn't load.
- Changing the class name of a driver wouldn't always take effect until
  Squirrel-SQL was restarted.
- The session properties dialog is now correctly positioned on screen.
- The Class Loader used for the JDBC drivers wasn't searching for classes
  correctly.

Enhancements
------------
- The number of rows in a table can be displayed in the object tree. This
  is controlled by a new session setting.
- The Aliases and Drivers lists are now in their own windows.
- A "Connect To" dropdown has been added to the toolbar.
- The SQL tab in the Application Preferences dialog has been split into
  two tabs; global settings that apply to all open sessions and a Default
  tab that applies to new sessions.
- If the Look and Feel is changed it is not shown until the application
  is restarted. Not all components are rendered correctly if the Look and
  Feel is changed on the fly.
- The System Status dialog has been merged with the About Box.
- New global property - Show Tooltips.

  alias/driver had its name changed or one was deleted.

  defaulted to rollback.
