/**

 *
 * If the underlying data maintained by the application may be
 * changed by the user through the framework interface, then the fw
 * objects must be able to get back to the application objects to
 * tell them what the change is.  The signature of the method to be
 * used to signal that change will depend on the type of underlying data
 * (e.g. list, table, etc.), but the setup of the fw code from the
 * application is done at a fairly high level, so that data type is not
 * known at the time that the application object creates the fw objects.
 * Therefore, we define this interface as a data type so that the application
 * code (e.g. 
 * net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.mainpanel.objecttree.tabs.BaseDataSetTab)
 * may tell the fw code in 
 * net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.datasetviewer.DataSetScrollingPanel
 * that the calling object is editable and must be saved in the fw
 * objects for later reference.
 * 
 * While this interface is defined within the fw object tree, it is
 * actually for use by application objects.  Thus, you will find the
 * objects implementing this interface in the application tree, not here.
 * The reason for this is that the fw code is intended to be reusable, so
 * we need a reusable data type for making callbacks into the application,
 * and that data type must be defined in fw.
 * 
 * This interface must be extended by another interface that handles
 * the actual call from fw to application to update the data. For example:
 * net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.datasetviewer.IDataSetUpdateableTableModel
 * is the interface used to update table objects.
