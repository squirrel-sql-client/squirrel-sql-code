AdditionalCatalogsDlg.title=Choose additional catalogs to load

AdditionalCatalogsDlg.explain=By default, SQuirreL does not specify catalogs when it loads schema data (tables, ...) \
  but relies on the database's built in behaviour which in some cases depends on the connections current catalog. \
  (The current catalog can be switched by the catalogs drop down). \
  Here users can choose catalogs that should be loaded additionally to SQuirreL's default schema data loading.
