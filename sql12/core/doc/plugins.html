<A NAME="introduction"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>

A plugin is an application written in Java that runs within SQuirreL. This
allows developers to enhance the functionality of SQuirreL without having to
rebuild the SQuirreL application itself.

<P>This document (like the plugin API itself) is in a very early stage and is lagging
behind the plugin API. Its suggested that you check the existing plugins in CVS to
see how they use the API.

<A NAME="licence"><H3>What Licence should I Use?</H3></A>

Please bear in mind when you are reading this section that I am not a lawyer. All
my comments reflect how I believe licencing of free and open source software
works. If you have any questions I suggest you consult a lawyer.

<P>If you're just writing a plugin for your personal use then licencing
doesn't matter but if you intend to distibute your plugin (either through
the SourceForge release system in the SQuirreL SQL Client project or in any
other way) then the licence you select should be compatible with the GNU General
Public Licence that SQuirreL is distributed under.

<P>I believe (although as I said I am not a lawyer) that as long as your plugin
is dynamically linked into SQuirreL (as it will be because thats how the
plugin API works) then any OSI approved licence should be appropriate.

<P>Unless you have a philosophical dislike of the GNU GPL I suggest you release
your plugin under it so that I don't wonder if your choice of licence is
going to cause me any problems &lt;grin/&gt;.

<P>For more information about licences please see <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org">The Free
Software Foundation</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</A>
or the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=778&group_id=1">
documents</A> at SouceForge about selecting a licence.

<A NAME="internalname"><H3>The Internal Name</H3></A>

A plugins internal name is used to uniquely identify it and so
must be different to that of any other plugin. It is supplied by
implementing the <TT>IPlugin.getInternalName()</TT> method. As the
internal name is used to name files and directories it should
only consist of characters valid on the different platforms that SQuirreL
can run on. As well the character &quot;-&quot; is reserved for internal
use. The internal name &quot;app&quot; is reserved for the use of
the core SQuirrel code.</P>

<A NAME="packagename"><H3>What Package can I put my Plugin into?</H3></A>

If you already have a domain name that you use for naming java packages
and you'd like to use that then by all means do so. If you don't have a domain
name then as a convienience the package
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.plugins.&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT> is
available. Using this package name does <EM>not</EM> in any way imply my
ownership of your code. This resides with you under the conditions of the
licence that you have selected for your plugin.

<P>As an example the internal name for the <EM>Look and Feel</EM> plugin
is <TT>laf</TT>.</P>

<P>To reserve an internal name just email a request to the SQuirreL
developers mailing list (details at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/squirrel-sql-develop)
specifying the internal name that you'd like and a quick description of your plugin.</P>

<A NAME="files"><H3>Files and Directories</H3></A>

Plugins are installed as a jar file within the <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT>
directory. The name of the jar file should be the same as the internal name of
one of the plugins within it plus a <TT>.jar</TT> extension. E.G. if the
internal name of the plugin is <TT>laf</TT> then the jar file should be
named <TT>laf.jar</TT>. No other files should be placed within the
<TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT> directory.

<P>The directory <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins/&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT>
is reserved for the exclusive use of the plugin. All non-user specific
other files required by the plugin should be placed in here.</P>

<P>The directory <TT>&lt;user_home&gt;/.squirrel-sql/plugins/&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT>
is also reserved for the exclusive use of the plugin. All &quot;per-user&quot;
files should be placed in here.</P>

<A NAME="loading"><H3>How Plugins are Loaded</H3></A>

Plugins are loaded very early in the SQuirreL startup process. Once the
application logging factory has been created the
plugins are loaded. All jars in the <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT>
directory are loaded by the same custom class loader. The jars are searched
for all classes that implement the <TT>IPlugin</TT> interface. Then
<TT>newInstance</TT> is used to create an instance of each of these plugin
classes. Once created the <TT>IPlugin.load()</TT> method is called. Because
most of the SQuirreL environment hasn't yet been setup try not to use the
plugin constuctor and <TT>load()</TT>method to do initialisation. Instead
use the <TT>IPlugin.initialize()</TT> method.

<P><TT>IPlugin.initialize()</TT> is called as the last part of the
SQuirreL startup prior to showing the main window. This is where initialization
of the plugin should occur. Please try to keep the amount of code executed
here to a minimum as it will affect the startup time of SQuirreL. If
possible do plugin initialization when a plugin is first requested by the user.</P>

<A NAME="pluginclasses"><H3>Plugin Classes</H3></A>

All plugin jars should contain at least one class that implements the
interface <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.IPugin</TT>. If
your plugin is applicable to a session then it should implement the
descendent of <TT>IPlugin</TT>,
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.ISessionPlugin</TT>. As a convienence
two abstract base classes have been supplied:
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.DefaultPlugin</TT> and
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.DefaultSessionPlugin</TT>. As
well as supplying some useful base behaviour these base classes should guard
against additions to the base interfaces breaking existing implementations.
Every attempt will be made to supply appropriate default behaviour (usually
an empty method) to the base classes for every method added to the interfaces.

<A NAME="api"><H3>Plugin API</H3></A>

There are two main ways for a plugin to communicate with SQuirreL. These are
via the <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.IApplication</TT> interface
which specifies the application level API and
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.ISession</TT> which specifies
the session level API. From within a descendent of <TT>BasePlugin</TT> you
can call <TT>getApplication()</TT> to get the <TT>IApplication</TT> object
and descendents of <TT>BaseSessionPlugin</TT> will have <TT>ISession</TT>
passed on requests.</P>

<A NAME="logging"><H4>Logging</H4></A>

Logging is done via the <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</A>
API from the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org">Apache Foundation</A>.

<P>The configuration file for logging is passed in via the
<TT>-loggingConfigFile</TT> application argument. E.G.
<TT>-loggingConfigFile=log4j.properties</TT>. The standard configuration file
specifies the appender <TT>SquirrelAppender</TT> which writes out to the
text file <TT>&lt;user-home&gt;\squirrel-sql\squirrel-sql.log</TT></P>

<P>To use logging in your classes you need to import the logging
classes:</P>

<PRE>
import net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.util.log.ILogger;
import net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.util.log.LoggerController;
</PRE>

<P>Create a static logging object:</P>

<PRE>
private static ILogger s_log = LoggerController.createLogger(&lt;your-class&gt;.class);
</PRE>

<P>And then you can use the logger:</P>

<PRE>
s_log.error("Error occurred loading Look and Feel: " + lafClassName, ex);
</PRE>

<P>Giving the output:</P>

<PRE>
12468 [main] ERROR net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.plugins.laf.LAFRegister  - Error occurred loading Look and Feel: com.l2fprod.gui.plaf.skin.LinuxLookAndFeel

<A NAME="loadinglibraries"><H4>Loading Libraries</H4></A>

??TODO??
&nbsp;

<A NAME="loadingrsrc"><H4>Loading Resources</H4></A>

??TODO??
(Be sure to talk about the difference between 
IPlugin.getPluginUserSettingsFolder and
IPlugin.getPluginAppSettingsFolder)

&nbsp;

<A NAME="addmenuitems"><H4>Adding Menu Items</H4></A>

There are several places where plugins may want to add menu items to allow the
user to activate plugin-specific behaviors.  The Object Tree is one of these 
places.  It displays objects of various types as defined in the class:
<pre>
    net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.sql.DatabaseObjectType
</pre>
The Object tree displays a popup 
menu when the user right-clicks (ctrl-click on Mac OS) on an object in the 
tree.  The SQuirreL API that allows plugins to add items to this menu for all 
objects (or objects of a specific type) is found in the IObjectTreeAPI interface 
for which an implementation can be obtained as follows:
<pre>
    IObjectTreeAPI api = session.getObjectTreeAPIOfActiveSessionWindow();
</pre>
You can find examples in the existing plugins where this is done in the method:
<pre>
    PluginSessionCallback sessionStarted(ISession session);
</pre> 
The sessionStarted method is called on all loaded plugins each time a new 
database session window is created (by the user clicking the "Connect" button 
while selecting an alias to connect to).  The 
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.PluginManager</TT> class is 
responsible for providing this notification to the loaded plugins.
<p>
Some useful methods for adding menu items in the IObjectTreeAPI interface are:
<pre>
	void addToPopup(DatabaseObjectType dboType, Action action);
	
	void addToPopup(DatabaseObjectType dboType, JMenu menu);
</pre>
These methods both take a DatabaseObjectType to determine which type of object
to add the menu item to.  DatabaseObjectType defines all public constants that
are used to identify types of objects found in the object tree.  For example 
there are:
<pre>
	DatabaseObjectType.FOREIGN_KEY
	DatabaseObjectType.FUNCTION
	DatabaseObjectType.INDEX
	DatabaseObjectType.PRIMARY_KEY
	DatabaseObjectType.PROCEDURE
	DatabaseObjectType.SCHEMA
	DatabaseObjectType.SEQUENCE
	DatabaseObjectType.TABLE
	DatabaseObjectType.UDT	
	DatabaseObjectType.VIEW	
</pre>
These are the ones most commonly used by plugins, but there are still more.  Any
object shown in the tree has a corresponding DatabaseObjectType constant that 
represents it type.
&nbsp;

<A NAME="addprefspanel"><H4>Adding a Panel to Application Preferences/Session Properties</H4></A>

To add a panel to the Application Preferences or to the Session Properties
dialog you need to create a class that implements either
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.preferences.IGlobalPreferencesPanel</TT>
or <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.properties.ISessionPropertiesPanel</TT>
and override <TT>IPlugin.getGlobalPreferencePanels()</TT> or
<TT>ISessionPlugin.getSessionPropertiesPanels()</TT>.

<P><TT>IGlobalPreferencesPanel.initialize(IApplication)</TT> or
<TT>ISessionPropertiesPanel.initialize(IApplication, ISession)</TT>
are called so that the options panel can initialise itself.</P>

<P><TT>String getTitle()</TT> is called to
retrieve the title for the panel.</P>

<P><TT>String getHint()</TT> is called
to get the tooltip hint for the panel.</P>

<P><TT>Component getPanelComponent()</TT> is called to
get the component that is actually placed in the dialog.</P>

<P><TT>void applyChanges()</TT></P> is called when the user
presses the OK button in the dialog. You should save your changes at this point.</P>

<A NAME="sqlexecution"><H4>Hooking into SQL Execution</H4></A>

The method <TT>ISession.addSQLExecutionListener(ISQLExecutionListener</TT>)
allows you to &quot;listen&quot; for SQL being executed in the SQL panel and modify
it. Remember to use <TT>ISession.removeSQLExecutionListener(ISQLExecutionListener)</TT>
to remove the listener when you are finished with it.

<P><TT>ISQLExecutionListener</TT> specifies one method:

<PRE>
public String statementExecuting(String sql)
</PRE>

<P>This method is called for every statement to be executed in the SQL panel. E.G. If the
user enters the following in the SQL panel:</P>

<PRE>
select * from table1;
select * from table2
</PRE>

<P>and requests them both to be executed then <TT>statementExecuting()</TT>
will be called twice. Once with <TT>&quot;select * from table1&quot;</TT>
passed and the second time with <TT>&quot;select * from table2&quot;</TT>.</P>

<P>Whatever you return from the method (allowing for any changes that other plugins
may make) is what will be executed. If you return <TT>null</TT> then no other listeners
will be called and the statement will not be executed.</P>

<P>This would be useful for macro expansion etc.</P>

<A NAME="xml"><H4>XML</H4></A>

SQuirreL now comes with the XML parser <A HREF="http://NanoXML.sourceforge.net/">NanoXML</A>.
Previously it came with <A HREF="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</A> but as I was using
almost none of the available functionality I replaced it with with a smaller one.

<A NAME="loadsavesettings"><H4>Loading and Saving Settings</H4></A>

The package <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.xml</TT> contains classes
that will take a javabean and turn it into XML and load a javabean
from XML. SQuirreL uses this for saving global preferences, driver and alias
configuration information.

<P>This is an example of the XML file that stores JDBC driver configuration
information.:</P>

<PRE>
&lt;Beans>
    &lt;Bean Class="net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.sql.SQLDriver"&gt;
        &lt;jarFileName/&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;jdbc:postgresql:&lt;//host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;&lt;/url&gt;
        &lt;identifier Class="net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.id.UidIdentifier"&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;-7&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/identifier&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;driverClassName&gt;org.postgresql.Driver&lt;/driverClassName&gt;
        &lt;usesClassPath&gt;true&lt;/usesClassPath&gt;
    &lt;/Bean&gt;
&lt;/Beans&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The following example shows how two javabeans can be
saved to an XML file.</P>

<PRE>
    XMLBeanWriter wtr = new XMLBeanWriter(bean1);
    wtr.addToRoot(bean2);
    wtr.save("javabeans.xml");
</PRE>

<P>This example shows the loading of javabeans from an XML
File:</P>

<PRE>
    XMLBeanReader rdr = new XMLBeanReader();
    rdr.load("javabeans.xml", getClass().getClassLoader());
    for (Iterator it = rdr.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {
        final Object Bean = it.next();
        ...
    }
</PRE>

<P>Because the <TT>XMLBeanReader</TT> has to instantiate the javabean
it needs to know the class loader that it used for the javabean's class
files. As plugins are loaded by a custom class loader this would normally
be the class loader used for the plugin classes.</P>

<P>The processing supplied by the classes in
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.xml</TT> is fairly rudimentary and
has some limitations. Chief amongst them is that is has no concept of
multiple references to the same object, it will save and restore multiple
objects in this case.</P>

<P>The properties of the javabean to be saved/restored can be builtin types,
instances of <TT>String</TT> or other javabeans. If you have a property that
doesn't fit this list then you can write a wrapper class to turn it into a
javabean. See the package
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.util.beanwrapper</TT> for
some examples.</P>

<P>Array properties are handled but currently not for builtin types nor
<TT>String</TT> objects. For these you need to use a wrapper class.</P>

<A NAME="objectcaches"><H4>Object Caches</H4></A>

??TODO??

<A NAME="addtab"><H4>Adding a Tab to the Main, Table or Procedure Tabbed Panel</H4></A>

To add a tab to the main tabbed panel (the one containing the &quot;Objects&quot; and
&quot;SQL&quot; tabs) use the <TT>ISession.addMainTab(String title, Icon icon,
Component comp, String tip)</TT> method. In the future this method will be
deprecated by being replaced by one similar to the one for the table
tabbed panel.

<P>To add a tab to the Table tabbed panel (the one displayed when you select
a table in the object tree) use the method
<TT>ISession.addTablePanelTab(ITablePanelTab)</TT>. For the Procedure tabbed
panel use the method <TT>ISession.addProcedurePanelTab(IProcedurePanelTab)</TT>.</P>

<P>You should create a class that implements either
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.objectstree.tablepanel.ITablePanelTab</TT>
or
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.objectstree.procedurepanel.IProcedurePanelTab</TT>
in order to create a tab. The methods <TT>getTitle()</TT> and
<TT>getHint()</TT> define the title and the flyover hint
respectively. Override <TT>getComponent()</TT> to provide
the actual component to be displayed in the tab (remember to wrap it in a
<TT>javax.swing.JScrollPane</TT> if the contents could be larger than the
tab).</P>

<P><TT>ITablePanelTab.setTableInfo(ITableInfo)</TT> will be called whenever
the currently selected table changes. For the procedure tab
<TT>IProcedurePanelTabsetProcedureInfo(IProcedureInfo)</TT>
will be called when the procedure changes. For performance reasons please
don't refresh the panel at this point. Use <TT>select()</TT>
for this. <TT>select()</TT> is called whenever the your tab is to be displayed.
Remember that this could be called multiple times without a different table
or procedure being selected in the object tree so you only need to refresh your
component the first time it is called.</P>

<P>As a convenience the classes
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.objectstree.tablepanel.BaseTableTab</TT>
and
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.objectstree.procedurepanel.BaseProcedureTab</TT>
have been provided. You would normally use these classes (which implement
<TT>ITablePanelTab</TT> and <TT>IProcedureTab</TT>) as the base for any tabs
you create.</P>

<P><TT>BaseTableTab</TT> and <TT>BaseProcedureTab</TT> provides the methods
<TT>getSession()</TT>, and <TT>getTableInfo()/getProcedureInfo()</TT>.
They also provide the method <TT>refreshComponent</TT> which will be called
the first time a tab is displayed for a table or procedure and is
the appropriate place to load the information to be displayed.</P>

<A NAME="sqloutputmodel"><H4>SQL Results Data Model</H4></A>

A data model <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.datasetviewer.IDataSetModel</TT>
is available for the SQL results. You can get it from <TT>ResultTab::getResultSetDataModel()</TT>
In the near future it will be added to the
content tab for the tables as well.

<A NAME="sqlresultsapi"><H4>SQL Results Tab API</H4></A>

An API in ISession allows a plugin to listen to events in the Result Tabs.

<PRE>
void addResultTabListener(IResultTabListener lis);
void removeResultTabListener(IResultTabListener lis);
</PRE>

<P><TT>IResultTabListener</TT> gives you:</P>

<PRE>
void resultTabAdded(ResultTabEvent evt);
void resultTabRemoved(ResultTabEvent evt);
void resultTabTornOff(ResultTabEvent evt);
void tornOffResultTabReturned(ResultTabEvent evt); /** Not yet implemented*/
