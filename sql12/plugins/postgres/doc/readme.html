<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The PostgreSQL plugin adds PostgreSQL-specific functionality to the SQuirreL SQL
Client. Read access is required to the following system views in order for this
additional functionality to work correctly:
<UL>
<li>information_schema.triggers</li>
<li>information_schema.views</li>
<li>pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes</li>
<li>pg_catalog.pg_index</li>
<li>pg_catalog.pg_proc</li>
<li>pg_catalog.pg_namespace</li>
</UL>
Note: Some statistical counts are only available when statistics collection 
is enabled.  The statistics collector must be configured to be launched before 
the server is started by setting stats_start_collector to true in postgresql.conf.
(This is the default setting) Additionally, statistics need to be sent to the 
collector with a few more configuration items which can be made at runtime.  To 
change these for a session the user needs to be a superuser.  This can be done 
in postgresql.conf or on a per-session basis with the following commands:<p>

<pre>
set stats_block_level to on 

set stats_row_level to on 
</pre>

Be aware that these settings will add overhead to query execution (which is why
they are disabled by default)

<H2>New Tabs</H2>

<P>Stored Procedures, Triggers and Views are shown in the object tree and have 
a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays the source of the selected object and 
a &quot;Details&quot; tab which gives PostgreSQL-specific information about the 
object.  Sequences and Indexes are also shown in the object tree and have a 
details tab giving DB2-specific information about them.  

<!-- INDEX -->

<h2>Index Details Tab</h2>
The index details tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree to the INDEX
folder beneath any table that has one or multiple indexes.  The index(es) will 
be listed by name under the table folder, and selecting one will place a 
details tab in the right-hand view of the session window.

<p>
The information provided by the details tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select inds.schemaname as schemaname, 
	       inds.relname as tablename, 
	       i.indisunique as is_unique, 
	       i.indisprimary as is_primary_key, 
	       i.indisclustered as is_clustered, 
	       inds.idx_scan as num_index_scans, 
	       inds.idx_tup_read as num_index_entries_returned, 
	       inds.idx_tup_fetch as num_table_rows_fetched 
	from pg_catalog.pg_index i, pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes inds 
	where i.indexrelid = inds.indexrelid 
	and inds.schemaname = ? 
	and inds.indexrelname = ?  
</pre>
<p>


<h2>Index Source Tab</h2>
The index source tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree as above and
selecting the "Source" tab which is adjacent to the "Details" tab. An example
is shown below:
<p>
<center>

</center>
<p>
The information provided by the source tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select indexdef 
	from pg_indexes 
	where schemaname = ? 
	and indexname = ? 
</pre>
<p>


<!-- STORED PROC SOURCE -->

<h2>Stored Procedure Source Tab</h2>
The Stored Procedure Source tab can be accessed by navigating to a schema and 
then to the PROCEDURE folder beneath the schema.  In the following picture, 
the schema is &quot;dbcopydest&quot;
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/procedure_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for stored procedures is derived by the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT p.prosrc FROM pg_proc p, pg_namespace n 
	where p.pronamespace = n.oid 
	and n.nspname = ? 
	and p.proname = ? 
</pre>

<!-- SEQUENCE -->

<h2>Sequence Details Tab</h2>
Sequences will appear in the object tree under the SCHEMA folder. The details 
tab for sequences displays information about the selected sequence according 
to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/sequence_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a sequence is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
SELECT last_value, max_value, min_value, cache_value, increment_by, is_cycled 
FROM  &lt;schema.sequencename&gt;
</pre>

<!-- TRIGGER SOURCE -->

<h2>Trigger Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for triggers displays the source for a table trigger and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;TRIGGER&quot; folder beneath a table 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for triggers is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select 'create trigger ' || trigger_name || ' ' || condition_timing 
           || ' ' || event_manipulation || ' on ' || event_object_table 
           || ' for each ' || action_orientation || ' ' || action_statement 
	from information_schema.triggers 
	where trigger_schema = ? 
	and trigger_name = ? 
</pre>
<p>

<!-- TRIGGER DETAILS -->

<h2>Trigger Details Tab</h2>
The details tab for triggers displays information about the selected trigger 
according to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a trigger is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	select condition_timing AS trigger_time, 
	       event_manipulation AS triggering_event, 
	       action_orientation AS granularity, 
	       event_object_table AS table_name 
	from information_schema.triggers 
	where trigger_schema = ? 
	and trigger_name = ? 
</pre>

<!-- VIEW SOURCE -->

<h2>View Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for views displays the source for a view and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;VIEW&quot; folder beneath a schema 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/view_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for views is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	select view_definition 
	from information_schema.views 
	where table_schema = ? 
	and table_name = ? 
</pre>
