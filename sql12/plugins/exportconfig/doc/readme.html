<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This plugin allows you to export the Database Driver definitions, the
Database Alias definitions and the Application Settings to files on the file
system. This lets you setup your defintions once and put them on as many other
PCs as you want to.</P>

<P>In order to use these files on another PC they need to be called
<TT>SQLDrivers.xml</TT> (Database Driver definitions), <TT>SQLAliases23.xml</TT>
(Database Alias definitions), and <TT>prefs.xml</TT> (Application Settings) and
placed in the directory <TT>.squirrel-sql</TT> within the users home
directory.</TT>

<H2>New Menu Options</H2>

<P>A new hierarchical menu &quot;Export&quot; has been added to the Plugins
menu. After taking one of the export options you will be prompted for a
directory to export to.</P>
