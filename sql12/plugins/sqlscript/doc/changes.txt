Bug Fixes
---------
- Firstly the "create data script" function would fail if the table/view was
  only accessible through its fully qualified name.(John Murga)
- Secondly the "create data script from SQL" didn't work for "select * from
  tablename" type queries (without a where clause). Which is a shame
  because this would have been a workaround for the other problem... (John Murga)
