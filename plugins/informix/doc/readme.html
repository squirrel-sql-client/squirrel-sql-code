<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The Informix plugin adds Informix-specific functionality to the SQuirreL SQL
Client. Read access is required to the following system views in order for this
additional functionality to work correctly:
<UL>
<li>informix.sysfragments</li>
<li>informix.sysindices</li>
<li>sysmaster:informix.sysptnhdr</li>
<li>informix.sysprocbody</li>
<li>informix.sysprocedures</li>
<LI>informix.systables</LI>
<li>informix.systriggers</li>
<li>informix.systrigbody</li>
<LI>informix.sysviews</LI>
</UL>

<H2>New Tabs</H2>

<P>Stored Procedures, Triggers and Views are shown in the object tree and have 
a &quot;Source&quot; tab which displays the source of the selected object and 
a &quot;Details&quot; tab which gives Informix-specific information about the 
object.  Sequences and Indexes are also shown in the object tree and have a 
details tab giving Informix-specific information about them.  

<!-- INDEX -->

<h2>Index Details Tab</h2>
The index details tab can be accessed by navigating the object tree to the INDEX
folder beneath any table that has one or multiple indexes.  The index(es) will 
be listed by name under the table folder, and selecting one will place a 
details tab in the right-hand view of the session window.

<p>
The information provided by the details tab for indexes is derived by the 
following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T1.owner     AS index_owner, 
	       T1.idxname   AS index_name, 
	       T2.owner     AS table_owner, 
	       T2.tabname   AS table_name, 
	       case T1.clustered 
	       when 'C' then 'CLUSTERED' 
	       else 'NON-CLUSTERED' 
	       end AS index_type, 
	       case T1.idxtype 
	         when 'U' then 'UNIQUE' 
	         else 'NON-UNIQUE' 
	         end AS uniqueness, 
	       T3.dbspace   AS table_space, 
	       T4.fextsiz   AS first_extent, 
	       T4.nextsiz   AS next_extent, 
	      ( 
	           SELECT  COUNT(*) 
	           FROM    sysmaster:informix.sysptnext 
	           WHERE   pe_partnum = T3.partn 
	       ) AS num_extents, 
	       T4.nptotal   AS pages_total, 
	       T4.npused    AS pages_used 
	FROM   informix.sysindices   AS T1, 
	       informix.systables    AS T2, 
	       informix.sysfragments AS T3, 
	       sysmaster:informix.sysptnhdr AS T4 
	WHERE   T1.tabid     >  99 
	AND     T2.tabid     = T1.tabid 
	AND     T3.tabid     = T1.tabid 
	AND     T3.indexname = T1.idxname 
	AND     T4.partnum   = T3.partn 
	AND     T1.owner = ? 
	AND     T1.idxname = ? 
	ORDER   BY 2 
</pre>
<p>

<!-- STORED PROC SOURCE -->

<h2>Stored Procedure Source Tab</h2>
The Stored Procedure Source tab can be accessed by navigating to a catalog, 
then to a schema and finally to the PROCEDURE folder beneath the schema.  In 
the following picture, the catalog is &quot;dbcopy&quot; and the schema is 
&quot;informix&quot;
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/procedure_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for stored procedures is derived by the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T1.procid, data 
	FROM informix.sysprocedures AS T1, informix.sysprocbody AS T2 
	WHERE procname = ? 
	AND T2.procid = T1.procid 
	AND datakey = 'T' 
</pre>

<!-- SEQUENCE -->

<h2>Sequence Details Tab</h2>
Sequences will appear in the object tree under the SCHEMA folder. The details 
tab for sequences displays information about the selected sequence according 
to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/sequence_details.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The information in the details tab for a sequence is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T2.owner     AS sequence_owner, 
	       T2.tabname   AS sequence_name, 
	       T1.min_val   AS min_value, 
	       T1.max_val   AS max_value, 
	       T1.inc_val   AS increment_by, 
	       case T1.cycle 
	         when '0' then 'NOCYCLE' 
	         else 'CYCLE' 
	       end AS cycle_flag, 
	       case T1.order 
	         when '0' then 'NOORDER' 
	         else 'ORDER' 
	        end AS order_flag, 
	       T1.cache     AS cache_size 
	FROM   informix.syssequences AS T1, 
	       informix.systables    AS T2 
	WHERE   T2.tabid     = T1.tabid 
	and T2.owner = ? 
	and T2.tabname = ? 
</pre>

<!-- TRIGGER SOURCE -->

<h2>Trigger Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for triggers displays the source for a table trigger and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;TRIGGER&quot; folder beneath a table 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_source.jpg">
</center>
<p>
The source code for triggers is derived from the following query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT  data 
	FROM    informix.systriggers AS T1, informix.systrigbody AS T2 
	WHERE   trigname = ? 
	AND     T2.trigid = T1.trigid 
	AND     datakey IN ('D', 'A') 
	ORDER   BY datakey DESC, seqno
</pre>
<p>

<!-- TRIGGER DETAILS -->

<h2>Trigger Details Tab</h2>
The details tab for triggers displays information about the selected trigger 
according to the system catalog. An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/trigger_details.jpg">

<p>
The information in the details tab for a trigger is derived from the following
query:
<p>
<pre>
	SELECT T1.owner     AS trigger_owner, 
	       T1.trigname  AS trigger_name, 
	       case T1.event  
	         when 'I' then 'INSERT' 
	         when 'U' then 'UPDATE' 
	         when 'D' then 'DELETE' 
	         when 'S' then 'SELECT' 
	         else T1.event 
	       end AS triggering_event, 
	       T2.owner     AS table_owner, 
	       T2.tabname   AS table_name, 
	       case T2.tabtype 
	         when 'T' then 'TABLE' 
	         when 'V' then 'VIEW' 
	         else T2.tabtype 
	       end AS table_type, 
	       T1.old       AS reference_before, 
	       T1.new       AS reference_after 
	FROM   informix.systriggers  AS T1, 
	       informix.systables    AS T2 
	WHERE   T2.tabid     = T1.tabid 
	and T1.trigname = ? 
</pre>

<!-- VIEW SOURCE -->

<h2>View Source Tab</h2>
The source tab for views displays the source for a view and can
be accessed by navigating to the &quot;VIEW&quot; folder beneath a schema 
object in the object tree.  An example of this is shown in the following 
picture:
<p>

	SELECT viewtext 
	FROM informix.systables AS T1, informix.sysviews AS T2 
	WHERE tabname = ? 
	AND T2.tabid = T1.tabid
